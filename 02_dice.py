#When we role two dice, the score is the sum of the two dice. 
# The score is a random number between 2 and 12.
# Write a program that simulates 100 rolls of two dice 
# and counts the frequencies of each score value.  
# Print is so that score is left aligned in a 10 character column
# and the frequency is right aligned in a 5 character column
