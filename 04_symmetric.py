# Using the alignment feature of the f formatter, 
# create script that will print one of the symmetric alphabets in a 10x10 grid
# The symmetric alphabets are A, H, I, M, O, T, U, V, W, X, Y
# For example, if the character you choose is X, the output should be:
"""
X         X
  X      X
    X  X
      X
    X  X
  X      X
 X         X  
"""
# use the overloaded * operator to repeat spaces
# for example " " * 3 will give you "   "
# use the f formatter to align the characters to the left or right
